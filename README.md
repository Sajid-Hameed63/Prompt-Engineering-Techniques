# Prompt-Engineering-Techniques (Created by ChatGPT)

Prompt Engineering involves designing effective prompts to guide AI models for optimal performance. Below are 11 key techniques:

---

## 1. Zero-Shot Prompting
- **Definition:** Asking the model to perform a task without providing examples.
- **Example:**  
  **Prompt:** "Summarize this article in one paragraph."
- **Use case:** Quick, simple tasks without needing prior context.

---

## 2. Few-Shot Prompting
- **Definition:** Providing examples before asking the model to generate a response.
- **Example:**  
  **Prompt:**  
  "Translate the following sentences from English to French.
  **Example 1:** 'Hello' → 'Bonjour'
  **Example 2:** 'How are you?' → 'Comment ça va?'
  **Now translate:** 'Good morning'"
- **Use case:** When more accuracy is required.

---

## 3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
- **Definition:** Encouraging step-by-step reasoning for better logical accuracy.
- **Example:**  
  **Prompt:**  
  "A farmer has 3 cows and 4 chickens. Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs. How many legs in total? Let's think step by step."
- **Use case:** Complex reasoning, math problems, and decision-making.

---

## 4. Self-Consistency Prompting
- **Definition:** Generating multiple responses and selecting the most common/consistent answer.
- **Use case:** Improves reliability in tasks like reasoning, coding, or factual responses.
- **Example:**
  **Prompt:**
  "Solve the following math problem multiple times and return the most common answer: 127 × 32."
---

## 5. Instruction-Based Prompting
- **Definition:** Clearly specifying instructions to guide the model’s behavior.
- **Example:**  
  **Prompt:**  
  "Write a professional email requesting a meeting. Keep it formal, concise, and polite."
- **Use case:** Tasks where structure, tone, or format matters.

---

## 6. Persona-Based Prompting
- **Definition:** Asking the model to adopt a specific role or style.
- **Example:**  
  **Prompt:**  
  "You are an expert software engineer. Explain recursion in Python in simple terms."
- **Use case:** When domain expertise or a specific writing style is needed.

---

## 7. Contextual Prompting
- **Definition:** Providing relevant background information to improve responses.
- **Example:**  
  **Prompt:**  
  "The Industrial Revolution started in the 18th century and transformed economies through mechanization. Based on this, explain its impact on modern industries."
- **Use case:** When responses need deeper contextual awareness.

---

## 8. Delimiting Prompting
- **Definition:** Using delimiters (quotes, brackets, etc.) to structure inputs and avoid confusion.
- **Example:**  
  **Prompt:**  
  "Summarize the following text accurately: {text content}"
- **Use case:** Prevents the model from misunderstanding inputs.

---

## 9. Iterative Refinement
- **Definition:** Adjusting prompts based on feedback to enhance response quality.
- **Example:**  
  - Initial Prompt: "Explain AI."
  - Refined Prompt: "Explain AI in simple terms for a 12-year-old."
- **Use case:** Ensures better alignment with expectations.

---

## 10. Negative Prompting
- **Definition:** Explicitly stating what the model should avoid.
- **Example:**  
  **Prompt:**  
  "Write a description of a city, but do NOT mention its name."
- **Use case:** Avoiding biases, unwanted details, or off-topic responses.

---

## 11. Prompt Chaining
- **Definition:** Breaking complex tasks into multiple smaller prompts and feeding the output of one as input to another.
- **Example:**  
  1. **First prompt:** "Extract the key points from this article."
  2. **Second prompt:** "Summarize these key points in two sentences."
- **Use case:** Handling multi-step tasks effectively.
